In this project, I created an explanatory data visualization that communicates clear findings and highlights relationships or patterns present in the prosper loan data set. My work was a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization using Tableau, and the final deliverable include a report which contains all the findings along with a Tableau Public workbook.
The Project report includes the following sections:
1. Summary: Brief description of the visualization and the findings were presented.
2. Design: Explained the design choices I made in creating the visualizations present in the tableau story.
3. Feedback: Include all feedback I received from others on my visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization.
